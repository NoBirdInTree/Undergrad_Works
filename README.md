# Codes and Reports:

I’ve done some quantitative researches in courses or in my internships.

## Extracurricular (internship) stuffs:

### 1. My current RA works in the biomed field. Details should be filled in Nov. or early Dec.. 

### 2. G-dWOLS Analysis of Fire Suppression Methods’ Effectiveness on Alberta Wildfires. (A well written report and codes are given)

I accomplished a funded independent research under Dr. Erica Moodie's supervision. I learned some methodologies in causal inference and carried out an in-depth data analysis with overlap weighting applied on regressions. The result is discussed under the framework of dynamic treatment regimens.

### 3. Political Polarization Study on Social Media during US Election Period. 

Scripts of some parts of this project are: 1. Word embedding script using BERT. 2. Graphical convolution network. 3. Building up the user graph. 4. Statistical computation on the embeddings like cosine similarity, silhouette score, topics frequency as well as the entropy of the distribution. 5. Bokeh visualization. I am mainly in charge of the 1, 4, 5 and some part of 2. One of papers has been accepted by the IEEE workshop.

### 4. Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker & R Dashboard. 

For tracker, click the link (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/), if it expires, I will uploaded a brief recording. R dashboard codes are given.

### 5. Financial data analysis. Some daily working codes are disclosed ...

-------------------------------------------------

## In-course stuffs:

### 1.In some of my stat courses, I investigated a few datasets in the generalize linear model course and the statistical learning course at which techniques like binomial (logistic), multinomial, poisson, quasi-poisson, gamma regressions with F/Wald/Wilk tests, and PCA, (multiple) correspondence analysis, various distance/similarity measures are used. The assignments (reports) are done using R. 

Some of my works in pdf files are attached. Some contents to the latest weekly Bios601's homework will be posted.

### 2. In some of my CS courses, I gained some experiences of executing computation tasks on the environment set up on AWS and GCP (Linux System), did some data crawling, annotation, analysis, learned some classical machine learning algorithms and practiced them on real world dataset (in-class Kaggle competition). 

Here are some toy codes which includes: 

---1. Scrapping data from html text. 
---2. Implementation of Naïve Bayes and Text Classification Task on Reddit (A Famous Forum). 
---3. MINST dataset number recognition using CNN.
